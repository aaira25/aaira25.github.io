<p> Problem Statement</p>
<p>The Cross Country team has been experiencing injuries over the past four years including shin splints, knee pain, and Achilles pain. Multiple studies have attributed these injuries to constant running on hard surfaces. In addition, knee and heel pain has also been attributed to bad foot placement. A solution should be created to help reduce or mitigate the amount of injuries.
